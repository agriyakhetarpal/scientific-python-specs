DESCRIPTION:Make your own JupyterLab extension in this tutorial. JupyterLab
  is a free and open source\, browser based integrated development 
 environment (IDE) that is the successor to Jupyter Notebook. Designed from
  the core to be extensible\, JupyterLab is itself an extension of the 
 Jupyter framework. Since its release\, open source developers have 
 contributed hundreds of third party extensions (652 third-party extensions

SUMMARY:Polars & Narwhals - Understanding Expressions When You're Used to 
 pandas
UID:711bad1b-f5fe-4726-8092-5f82719f687f@711b.org
DESCRIPTION:When it comes to dataframes\, pandas is the go-to library 
 for\nmany people. Yet Polars is taking the world by storm\, and so\nmany 
 data practitioners are curious about trying it out. There\nis a learning 
 curve though\, as Polars introduces some concepts\nwhich pandas users 
 might not be familiar with. This talk is a\ndeep dive into one of those 
 concepts (expressions) and will focus\non how you can understand them from
  a pandas perspective.\n\nMeetup: https://www.meetup.com/data-
